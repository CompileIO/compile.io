Description of Project: As former students of Rose Hulman Institute of Technology, we found that the infrastructure for grading and giving feedback on user-submitted code was insufficient. We propose a senior project to develop a scalable web application to benefit both students and professors of the CSSE department.

We would prefer to work in an agile environment in order to provide a minimum viable product by the end of this project. Our minimum viable product will include the following features:

●      Students can submit code in several languages (e.g. Java, Python, Scheme, C, C#, C++) to a server and receive feedback.

●      Professors can configure homework assignments to have specific test cases and can assign a maximum number of attempts, maximum run time, assignment open and close times, etc...

●      The system should be scalable to handle multiple classes worth of submissions at a time.

After this project, students will have been exposed to several new concepts such as full-stack web application development, scalable software architecture, and possibly AWS/cloud configuration.

Any documentation (save for this README file) relevant to this project can be found in the *Documentation* folder in the repository.

Required Programming Language(s), Operating System, Hardware Platform (if known):

One of Java/C#/NodeJS for the backend, Javascript for the frontend, any OS is acceptable
